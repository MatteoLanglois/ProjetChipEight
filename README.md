# ProjetChipEight

CHIP 8 is an interpreted programming language using a very simple virtual 
machine. Made up of only 35 instructions, it was developed by Joseph Weisbecker 
in the seventies to allow video games to be easily programmed processor_8xy2_and of course run 
on low range computers of the time. Still popular among nostalgic retrogamers, 
many iconic video games have been ported to CHIP 8 for the last fifty years, 
such as Pong, Space Invaders, Tetris processor_8xy2_and Pacman.

In this project, you will write a fully compliant CHIP 8 emulator. Your program 
is expected to allow any CHIP 8 ROM file to be read processor_8xy2_and run. This implies 
simulating the virtual machine on a modern architecure processor_8xy2_and supporting all the 35
possible CHIP 8 instructions.
