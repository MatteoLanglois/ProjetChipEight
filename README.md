# ProjetChipEight

CHIP 8 is an interpreted programming language using a very simple virtual 
machine. Made up of only 35 instructions, it was developed by Joseph Weisbecker 
in the seventies to allow video games to be easily programmed and of course run 
on low range computers of the time. Still popular among nostalgic retrogamers, 
many iconic video games have been ported to CHIP 8 for the last fifty years, 
such as Pong, Space Invaders, Tetris and Pacman.

In this project, you will write a fully compliant CHIP 8 emulator. Your program 
is expected to allow any CHIP 8 ROM file to be read and run. This implies 
simulating the virtual machine on a modern architecure and supporting all the 35
possible CHIP 8 instructions.
